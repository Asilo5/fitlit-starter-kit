# FitLit Starter Kit

Fitlit is a fitness tracker for users. In this app users are able to track their sleep, water intake, and activity for a day as well as for a week. 

This project is a two week project at Turing School of Software & Design, and was made to help us learn how to implement OOP (Object Oriented Programming). We as well needed to create a testing suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of the application.
